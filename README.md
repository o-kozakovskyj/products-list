## Stack:
- React[https://reactjs.org/]

- Sass[https://sass-lang.com/]
### User Stories:
- As a user, I want to see a list of products
- As a user, I want to add a product to the list
- As a user, I want to delete a product
!!!Important: The list of products changes on server after deleting a product. But API recovers the data. So, if you delete a product, you can see it again after refreshing the page.
!!! APi adds all products to the list with id=101 & cant delete them. So, if you add a product, you can`t delete them.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
